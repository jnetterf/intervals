Satie [![Test status][test_status]][test_link]
==============================================

Satie is a JavaScript library for rendering sheet music.

* Converts [MusicXML][musicxml] to [SVG][svg]. Most sheet music formats can be converted to MusicXML, and SVGs can be converted to many other formats.
* Runs in Node and modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 10+).
* Provides fast updates. Satie was designed to be a component of a sheet music editor.

Satie is not yet ready for production use.
